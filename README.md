# baku
A super simple directory and file backup program.
Program developed 4-Aug-2020 by Joshua Daybrest.

What this program is intended to do:
- Analyze one directory against another and report the differences.
- Copy any files that exist in the source directory into the destination directory (creating directories as needed).

What it does not do:
- Copy files that have the same name yet are different.

I don't know why this was necessary, and I'm sure theres a more elegant way to do this in windows... Don't shoot me please.
